# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
## The project was to perform an analysis of kickstarter data using excel. While performing analysis we created visual aids to convey the findinds.     

### Purpose
### The purpose of this analysis was to see if there was any correlation between a kickstarters launch date and the outcome. 

## Analysis and Challenges
## We began the analysis using excel to sort and fileter data to find our correct information. One challenge I ran into was while trying to create the Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png. The line graph I had initially selected wouild repeatedly set the Y-axis to percent. I realized after attempting to fix the chart, that I needed to select a different line graph to get the correct result. Another issue I ran into was with the filter of Theater vs Outocme Pivot table. I was having a difficult time making the months appear. I realized when I placed the year in the row category that I needed to removed other auto added "quarter" and "year" options that excel had added in. Once I removed these I was left with the months. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
## After examining the data we can see that the trends in failed kickstarters and successful ones seem to follow a similar trend. For the most part when we see a spike a failures we also see a spike in success. The best time it appears to launch a kickstarter in the May. From May to July we see that there is a massive spike in successful kickstarters. December appeared to be the worst time to start a kickstarter as the successful and failed projects were almost equal.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
## Based on the data we can se that the  most successful kickstarter plays had goals set between >9999 and 30000 to 39999. The most successful kickstarters had goals less than 1000. After 40000, success rates dropped significantly with 40000 to 44999 have 0% success rates. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
## Two conclucsion we can determine are, 1) Spring and early summer are the best times to start a kickstarter and 2) Decemeber is the worst time to start one.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

## We can conclude that if you would like your kickstarter to be successful you should aim for a goal less than 9999. Projects between 30000 and 39999 are also successful. If you try for a large project in excess of 40000 there is a statistically proven chance you will fail. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
## This data is limited by the fact it only covers kickstarters. There are plenty of other ways to fund and raise money for plays that, when taken into account could change our outcomes. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
## We could create scater plots to try and creatyed predictive models and find the level or correlation in our data. This could help us determine other factors.
